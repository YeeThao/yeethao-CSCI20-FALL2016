/*
Computer will randomly generate a number between 1 and 10. It will then prompt
the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. A code will compare the two numbers,
if the generated number is greater than the user input then it will then display 
"higher" and ask for the user to input again. If the computer generated number is 
less than the user input then it would display "lower" and again ask for the user 
enter another number. When the user gets the number right it will add 10 to the 
user's score. In the beginning the user starts with zero so if they get one right 
10 will be added and they will end up with 10 points. It will also be displayed 
so the user can keep track of their score. Each time they get a guess wrong one 
will be taken away from the total score of the user.
